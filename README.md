# Smart Contract Audit Repository

This repository contains some example and competitive audits of smart contracts, aiming to provide insights into the tools and best practices that are used.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:  
- Showcase reference audits.  
- Provide **example audits** of intentionally vulnerable contracts to highlight common pitfalls.  

## Repository Structure

- **[Example Audits](./example-audits):**  
  Contains audits of contracts designed with intentional vulnerabilities for educational purposes.  
  - [TSwap Audit](https://github.com/mlbyvn/audits/tree/main/example-audits/tswap): A fork of Uniswap V1 with added vulnerabilities.  


- **[Competitive Audits](./competitive-audits):**  
Will be added soon.

## Tools and Techniques

The audits in this repository leverage a combination of industry-standard tools and manual techniques, including:  
- **Static Analysis:** Tools like [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) and [Aderyn](https://github.com/crytic/aderyn).  
- **Dynamic Testing:** Fuzz testing and invariant-based approaches to detect runtime vulnerabilities.  
- **Manual Review:** Identifying nuanced logic errors and ensuring adherence to best practices.
