# Example Audits Repository

Welcome to the **Example Audits** repository! This collection will provide detailed security audits of various smart contracts, highlighting common vulnerabilities and showcasing best practices for decentralized application development.

## Contents

- **TSwap Audit:**  
  An audit of TSwap, a deliberately vulnerable Uniswap V1 fork, highlighting typical DEX issues like lack of slippage protection, MEV attacks, business logic issues and more.

## Tools and Techniques

The audits leverage the following tools and approaches:  
- **Static Analysis:** Using tools like [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) and [Aderyn](https://github.com/Cyfrin/aderyn) to identify security issues.  
- **Dynamic Testing:** Applying invariant testing and fuzzing to uncover runtime vulnerabilities.  
- **Manual Code Review:** Ensuring business logic correctness and uncovering edge-case flaws.
